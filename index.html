					<p>This is a big ole paragraph about me mang, I ain't filled it up yet but I will. Today we are covering more CSS stuff and booyaa. Here is a Samuel L Jackson monologue. </p> 
					<p>There’s a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. “The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you.” Now… I been sayin’ that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, that meant your ass. You’d be dead right now. I never gave much thought to what it meant. I just thought it was a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker before I popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin’ made me think twice. See, now I’m thinking: maybe it means you’re the evil man. And I’m the righteous man. And Mr. 9mm here… he’s the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or it could mean you’re the righteous man and I’m the shepherd and it’s the world that’s evil and selfish. And I’d like that. But that shit ain’t the truth. The truth is you’re the weak. And I’m the tyranny of evil men. But I’m tryin’, Ringo. I’m tryin’ real hard to be the shepherd. </p>

[Dilla]
Hey baby what love got to do with this
Huh, yeah I don't know, but umm
Yeah, you know what love is
Say it with me one time (you know what love is)

[Chorus]
Inside this love with me

[T3 during Chorus]
T3 is on some love tip y'all (you know what love is)
See the S is on some love tip (you know what love is)
T3 is on some love tip y'all (you know what love is)
T3 is on some love tip (you know what love is)

[T3]
She said "I wanna be down with the S"
I said "Certainly and let me taste your splendorness"
Bustin a Virgo, you were scandalous
Your fragrance got me losin consciousness
Your stance got me unbucklin my fuckin pants
Spendin, clams to finance on the two dollar romance
Take this dick, to the tip, get a lick
Tell a bitch, the S is the shit, so eat a dick
You need to... just give me your clit
So I can get nasty like an old porno flick
Oral sex, got me caught up in the {?} bliss
T-Cedric, as I drop this dick between her tits
Yessssss...

[Chorus]

[Baatin]
Yeah, one on one havin' fun in my master suite
It's two o'clock, time to go and see the wee
The out cat, got a V.I.P
Lapdance, cutie romancin'
I picture you at my crib
Aerobics, got you straight up flexible
I'm tellin' you, you the one that I like
I'm smellin' you, but you smell so nice
I really like the way you listen to my advice
On how you never - you never fight
I really wanna, take you home
And do you, on my bearskin rug
Romancin...

[Chorus to fade]

[Dilla during Chorus]
Aiyyo baby what love got to do with this
Yo, I don't know, but umm
Yeah, you know what love it is
Say it with me one time (you know what love is)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (you know what love is)
Yo I don't know (you know what love is)
You know what love is...
